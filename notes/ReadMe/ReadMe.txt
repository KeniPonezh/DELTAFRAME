This whole folder contains character script to make the player more manageable to go around with
These cut down the lines of code in the player object and handl everything through
the scripts, from auto character sprite choose to collision through tiles, which is no different from
object tiling and honestly far better in many istances.
Player Object got comment out lines of code for a more flexible script replacement in both Create and Step
All the new code is commented out for you to decide whether or not to use it.
Also commented out some of your code too
